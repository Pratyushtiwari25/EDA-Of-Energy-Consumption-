# Energy Consumption Data Analysis in India

## Overview

This repository contains the exploratory data analysis (EDA) of energy consumption data in India. The analysis aims to uncover patterns, trends, and insights from the data, which can be valuable for understanding the energy landscape in the country.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis includes energy consumption statistics across different sectors and regions in India. It comprises data on electricity usage, fossil fuel consumption, renewable energy generation, and more.

## Files

- `data/`: This directory contains the raw and processed data files.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks used for EDA.
  - `EDA_energy_consumption.ipynb`: The main notebook containing the EDA.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts used for data cleaning and preprocessing.
- `README.md`: This README file.

## Installation

To run the notebooks and scripts, you need to have Python installed along with the necessary libraries. You can install the required libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pratyushtiwari25/energy-consumption-india.git
```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

```bash
cd energy-consumption-india
```

3. Open the Jupyter notebook for EDA:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/EDA_energy_consumption.ipynb
```

## Analysis Summary

### Key Findings

- **Overall Energy Consumption**: Analysis of the overall energy consumption patterns in India over the years.
- **Sector-wise Analysis**: Breakdown of energy usage across different sectors such as residential, industrial, and agricultural.
- **Regional Trends**: Insights into energy consumption trends across various states and regions.
- **Renewable Energy**: Examination of the growth and impact of renewable energy sources.
- **Peak Demand**: Identification of peak demand periods and their implications.

### Visualizations

The EDA includes various visualizations to help understand the data better:
- Line plots showing trends over time.
- Bar charts comparing energy usage across sectors.
- Heatmaps highlighting regional consumption patterns.
- Pie charts illustrating the share of different energy sources
- Differnt types of plots by utilising the data
